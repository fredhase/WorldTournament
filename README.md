# WorldTournament
Simple CRUD made with C# and using azure's sql server

The ideia is to register fighters in the World Martial Arts Tournament, based on Dragon Ball Z. 
You can simply register, edit, delete or just fighters information. Made for studying C# and sql.

Please, request database information (like user and password) to the developer.
This info should be placed in DBConnect -> Connect()
There are empty strings where the info would be placed.

You can also use your own sql server using a table named "Fighter".
Just place your sql info in the same file mentioned above.
